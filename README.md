## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Copy the example config file and fill in with your settings:

```

Key config sections:

- `db`: connection to local or remote storage for state
- `mahadbt`: polling endpoint, credentials (if any)
- `notifications`: providers and templates
- `interval`: how often the script checks (e.g. every 5 minutes)

Example snippet:

```json
{
  "mahadbt": {
    "url": "https://mahadbt.maharashtra.gov.in/api/scholarships",
    "auth": {
      "username": "...",
      "password": "..."
    }
  },
  "notifications": {
    "sms": {
      "provider": "Twilio",
      "accountSid": "...",
      "authToken": "..."
    },
    "email": {
      "smtpHost": "smtp.example.com",
      "port": 587,
      "user": "...",

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Start the alert engine with:

```bash
# Node.js

The service logs detected events and notifications. Alerts are sent automatically when new disbursements are identified.

For scheduled deployment, consider running under systemd, cron, or as a container.

## üß† Architecture & Workflow

1. **Polling**: Regularly fetch scholarship status via DBT portal/API.  
2. **State comparison**: Compare against stored state in DB.  
3. **Event detection**: Identify newly arrived funds or status changes.  
4. **Trigger alerts**: Send SMS/email based on template configurations.  
5. **Logging**: Store alert history and transaction logs for transparency.
